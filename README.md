# RNK – Recursive Neuro Key

**RNK** is a next-generation hybrid AI framework designed to **combine memory, reasoning, and language understanding**. It merges three core technologies into a single system:

1. **Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM)** – captures hierarchical and recursive patterns, enabling the AI to reason over multi-step, long-term dependencies.  
2. **Neuro-Symbolic Processing** – applies logical, rule-based reasoning on structured knowledge while integrating neural embeddings for flexibility.  
3. **RWKV Neural Network Core** – handles sequential data and natural language understanding, providing contextual embeddings for both reasoning and prediction.

## Key Features

- **Recursive Cognitive Loops:** RNK maintains and recalls past reasoning steps, enabling deep multi-step inference.  
- **Hybrid Reasoning:** Combines symbolic logic with neural sequence modeling for versatile decision-making.  
- **Scalable Architecture:** Modular design allows integration of small or large RWKV cores with HRM and Neuro-Symbolic layers.  
- **Multi-Modal Potential:** Though primarily language-focused, the architecture can be extended to structured or multi-modal datasets.  
- **Flexible Integration:** Each component is independent, allowing replacement, fine-tuning, or expansion without retraining the entire system.

## How RNK Works

1. **Input Processing:** Raw sequences (text, symbolic data, or structured input) are converted into embeddings using the RWKV core.  
2. **Symbolic Reasoning:** The Neuro-Symbolic module interprets these embeddings within logical frameworks, enforcing rules or constraints where applicable.  
3. **Hierarchical Memory:** HRM tracks hierarchical frames of knowledge and reasoning, storing recursive dependencies for long-term context.  
4. **Hybrid Output:** Outputs from all modules are combined to produce coherent decisions, predictions, or generated text.

## Conceptual Advantages

- **Combines Strengths:** RWKV excels at sequence prediction, Neuro-Symbolic reasoning handles structured logic, and HRM adds memory and recursion.  
- **Efficiency:** Pretrained RWKV cores provide powerful embeddings without full retraining, while HRM and symbolic modules add reasoning with minimal overhead.  
- **Extensibility:** Components can be upgraded independently, enabling iterative improvement or specialization for different tasks.
